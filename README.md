# Weather - App

This project brought together using a couple of API's - Open Weather and Giphy. I made use of both Async/Await syntax for handling requests as well as classic promise syntax. Handling promises took some adjusting to. Understanding that the await keyword would not work unless the function that wrapped a fetch request returned the actualy fetch call cleared a major problem in the development proccess.
